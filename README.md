# Serverless Product API

This is a simple API created using serverless AWS technologies. It supports three endpoints- one for creating new products, reading a single product, and searching products by tags.

The architecture of this application is very simple. It's a single AWS Lambda function running an Express server, and it makes read and write calls to a DynamoDB table. The lambda is exposed publically through an API Gateway endpoint.

The Express server and routes are contained in the `src/handler.js` file and there are two additional filesâ€“ `src/validate.js` that contains utility functions to enforce a set of rules on Product creation, and `src/dynamoScanBuilder.js` that has two utility functions used in building the search query for the DynamoDB scan.


## Technologies Used:
 - NodeJS 14.x
 - ExpressJS
 - Jest
 - Serverless Framework
 - AWS Lambda
 - AWS DynamoBD
 - AWS API Gateway

## Running Test Suite
There are some simple unit tests written in the `/test` directory. Additionally, there is a script in the `package.json` file that will run the test with coverage details. 

From the root directory, run:

`$ npm run test`
